# Headers Already Sent Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
WordPress admin settings page was causing "headers already sent" errors because form processing (POST handling) was happening inside the `render_settings_page()` method, which executes after HTML output has begun.

## Root Cause
- Settings form submission was processed in `render_settings_page()` 
- By the time this method is called, WordPress has already started outputting headers and HTML
- When `wp_redirect()` was called from within the render method, headers had already been sent
- This caused PHP errors and white screens

## Solution
Moved the form processing to the `admin_init` hook, which executes before any output:

### Changes Made

#### 1. Modified `admin/class-admin.php`
- Added `handle_settings_submission()` method to `admin_init()`
- Early detection of settings POST data
- Calls settings handler before any output begins

#### 2. Modified `admin/class-settings.php`
- Removed POST processing from `render_settings_page()`
- Added public `handle_settings_save()` method
- Simplified `save_settings()` method (removed output buffering complexity)
- `render_settings_page()` now only handles display

### Architecture Flow

**Before (Problematic):**
1. User submits form → WordPress loads admin page
2. WordPress starts outputting HTML
3. `render_settings_page()` called → detects POST data
4. `save_settings()` tries to call `wp_redirect()`
5. **ERROR: Headers already sent!**

**After (Fixed):**
1. User submits form → WordPress loads admin page
2. `admin_init` hook fires **BEFORE** any output
3. `handle_settings_submission()` detects POST and processes settings
4. `save_settings()` successfully calls `wp_redirect()`
5. User redirected to completion page
6. `render_settings_page()` never called due to redirect

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates "headers already sent" errors completely
- ✅ Consistent redirect behavior to completion screen
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (processing vs. display)
- ✅ Better user experience with proper completion flow
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Improved error handling

## Testing Performed
- Syntax validation of all modified files
- Architecture flow verification
- Error scenario testing
- User experience flow validation

The fix is minimal, surgical, and maintains backward compatibility while completely resolving the headers issue.
